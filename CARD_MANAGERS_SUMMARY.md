## 🏗️ **Architecture & Design**

### **Base Card Manager Class**
- **Inheritance**: All managers inherit from `BaseCardManager`
- **Common Methods**:
  - `analyze_request()` - Understands user requirements
  - `search_catalog()` - Finds relevant cards
  - `rank_cards()` - Scores and ranks recommendations
  - `execute()` - Runs the complete workflow

### **Specialized Overrides**
- Each manager overrides key methods for specialization:
  - `analyze_request()` - Adds domain-specific analysis
  - `_calculate_match_score()` - Enhances scoring for domain features

### **Data Models**
- **`CardRecommendation`**: Detailed card information with match scoring
- **`ManagerResult`**: Complete results from each manager
- **`GraphState`**: LangGraph state management

## 🔄 **Workflow & Integration**

### **1. Request Processing**
```
User Query → Extractor Agent → Router Agent → Card Manager(s)
```

### **2. Intelligent Routing**
- Router analyzes user goals and routes to appropriate managers
- Multiple managers can be invoked for mixed goals
- Fallback to general manager if no specific matches

### **3. Parallel Execution**
- Each manager works independently
- Results are aggregated in the graph state
- Ready for summary agent processing
